// In JS, there're 3 ways to declare variable

var x = 9;
let y = 8;
const z = 10;

// var keyword:

// Function scoped, fuction-level scope (function {...})
// Available anywhere in the function, from LINE 1 of the function EVEN when it's DECLARED in line 10
// Can be changed in the scope 

// let keyword:

// similar to var, but in block-level scope ({...})
// Available inside the block, and from the line AFTER it's DECLARED
//Can be changed in the scope

// const keyword:

//similar to let, but can NOT be changed in the scope


// When to use :
// const: in anywhere
// let: in a loop block-level
